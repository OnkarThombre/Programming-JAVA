insert krtana hotat but while peek and remove always smallest element get peeked or removed

```
30, 10, 20

This is VERY important for interviews.

# ⭐ **PriorityQueue Internal Working**

Java's `PriorityQueue` uses a **Min-Heap** internally.

✔ Implemented using an **array**
✔ Smallest element is always at **index 0**
✔ Heap property is maintained after each insertion
✔ The queue does NOT store elements in sorted order internally
✔ But **poll()** always returns the smallest element

---

# ⭐ INSERTION STEPS: 30, 10, 20

Let's see it step by step (with heap diagrams).

---

# ⭐ Step 1 → Insert 30

Heap:

```
[30]
```

✔ No parent to compare
✔ Heap ok

---

# ⭐ Step 2 → Insert 10

Temporarily insert at next available index.

```
      30
     /
   10
```

Array internally:

```
[30, 10]
```

Now heapify (compare child with parent):

```
10 < 30 → swap
```

New heap:

```
      10
     /
   30
```

Array internally:

```
[10, 30]
```

---

# ⭐ Step 3 → Insert 20

Insert at next position (right child):

```
      10
     /  \
   30    20
```

Array temporarily:

```
[10, 30, 20]
```

Compare 20 with parent (10):

```
20 >= 10 → no swap
```

Heap remains:

```
      10
     /  \
   30    20
```

Internal array:

```
[10, 30, 20]
```

---

# ⭐ Final Internal Structure After 30, 10, 20

Heap:

```
      10
     /  \
   30    20
```

Array inside PriorityQueue:

```
[10, 30, 20]
```

---

# ⭐ VERY IMPORTANT POINT

When you print:

```java
System.out.println(pq);
```

Output may show:

```
[10, 30, 20]
```

But this does NOT mean:

* It is sorted
* It is stored in the same order you inserted

PriorityQueue **only guarantees**:
👉 `peek()` returns smallest
👉 `poll()` removes smallest

Internally it keeps **min-heap** structure, NOT sorted list.

---

# ⭐ What happens if we poll?

```java
pq.poll(); // returns 10 (smallest)
```

Heap becomes:

```
      20
     /
   30
```

Bilkul **sahi samajla tu**, Onkar! 🔥
Now I’ll explain **WHY insertion order random asto BUT peek() & poll() hamesha smallest element detat** — in the cleanest Marathi–English mix so you understand 100%.

# ⭐ PriorityQueue — MAIN RULES

### ✔ **Insertion** → heap madhye jato (NOT sorted order)

### ✔ **Peek / Poll** → ALWAYS smallest element deto

Yachachach **PriorityQueue cha main purpose** ahe.

---

# ⭐ Why inserting 30, 10, 20 gives output like:

```
[10, 30, 20]
```

OR sometimes:

```
[10, 20, 30]
```

(but mostly the first)

Because **PriorityQueue is NOT a sorted list**.
It is a **Min-Heap**.

---

# ⭐ Min-Heap Kaam kasa karto?

### RULE 1:

**Root (index 0) = smallest element** → this is REQUIRED.

### RULE 2:

**Left–right children** MUST follow heap rule but NOT sorted.

Yacha mhanje:

```
root = smallest
children = can be larger, in any order
```

---

# ⭐ So insert karताना kay hota?

When you insert:

```
30 → first element  
10 → compare with parent → swap  
20 → insert as child, compare with parent → no swap
```

Final heap:

```
      10
     /  \
   30    20
```

Array form:

```
[10, 30, 20]
```

BUT this is **VALID min-heap**.

---

# ⭐ Now WHY peek() always gives smallest?

Because **root (index 0)** ALWAYS holds the minimum element.

`peek()` = return root
`poll()` = remove root → then rearrange heap → new smallest goes to root

---

# ⭐ EXAMPLE

### Insert:

```
30, 10, 20
```

Heap becomes:

```
      10
     /  \
   30    20
```

### `peek()`:

*returns 10*

### `poll()`:

*remove 10*
Heap updated:

```
      20
     /
   30
```

Now smallest = 20 at root.

---

# ⭐ Final Simple Explanation (for interview)

> **PriorityQueue does NOT store elements in sorted order.
> It stores them in a Min-Heap structure.
> The smallest element is always at the root, so peek() and poll() always return the minimum element first.**

Insertion is random heap structure,
but **root always minimum** → therefore smallest element always removed first.

QQQQQQ ??????

Great, Onkar! 🔥
Let’s explain **exactly HOW PriorityQueue stores elements internally** when you insert:

```
30, 10, 20
```
