# 🧩 **QUESTION ANALYSIS**

**“Which is the root of the Collection Framework?”**

Many students get confused because:

* *Collection Framework* ≠ *Collection interface*
* Map does NOT extend Collection
* Iterable is also involved at the top

So let’s break it properly.

---

# ✅ **CORRECT ANSWER**

### 💥 **Iterable is the root interface of the Java Collection Framework.**

(Except Map hierarchy, which is separate)

---

# 🧠 **WHY? (Explanation)**

The hierarchy looks like this:

```
Iterable  ← root of collection hierarchy
   ↑
Collection
   ↑
List, Set, Queue
```

### ✔ **Iterable**

* Is the **top-most interface**
* Provides the ability to use **foreach loops**
* Every Collection class must implement Iterable

### ✔ **Collection**

* Is the **root interface of the Collection hierarchy**, not the entire framework
* Child interfaces: List, Set, Queue

### ✔ **Map**

* Part of the Collection *Framework*
* BUT not part of **Collection hierarchy**
* Does NOT extend Collection or Iterable

# 🧩 **FINAL INTERVIEW ANSWER**

### ⭐ **BEST ANSWER:**

> “The root interface of the Java Collection Framework is **Iterable**.
> The root interface of the *Collection hierarchy* is **Collection**.
> Map is also part of the framework but it does not extend Collection.”

# 🏆 **If interviewer asks only ‘root of Collection Framework’**

Say:

> **Iterable is the root of the Collection Framework.**

# 🏆 **If interviewer asks ‘root of Collection interface hierarchy’**

Say:

> **Collection is the root of the Collection hierarchy.**
