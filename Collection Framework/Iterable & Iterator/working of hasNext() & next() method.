Excellent, Onkar! 🔥
Let’s answer this **VERY CLEARLY**, so your confusion ends forever.

# ⭐ You asked 2 questions:

### **Q1 → Does hasNext() move the cursor?**

### **Q2 → Does next() first move or first return the element?**

Let’s answer them one by one.

---

# ⭐ ✅ **Q1 — You are correct!**

### ✔ `hasNext()`

* ONLY **checks** if next element exists
* Does **NOT** move the cursor
* Does **NOT** return any element

Example:

Cursor before A:

```
^ A B C
```

`hasNext()` → true
Cursor still:

```
^ A B C
```

### 🎯 Final Statement:

> **hasNext() does NOT move the iterator. It only checks availability.**

✔ You are right.

---

# ⭐ ❌ Q2 — Your earlier understanding was incorrect

You thought:

> “hasNext() checks AND moves forward”

❌ WRONG
hasNext() **never moves**.

You thought:

> “next() gives element AND then moves further”

This part is ALMOST correct but needs precision.

---

# ⭐ ✅ **Correct behavior of next():**

### ✔ next() FIRST moves cursor forward

### ✔ THEN returns the element at the NEW cursor position

Example:

Initial:

```
^ A B C
```

Call next():

1️⃣ Cursor moves to A
2️⃣ A is returned

New cursor position:

```
A ^ B C
```

# ⭐ ⭐ FINAL ANSWERS ⭐ ⭐

## ✔ Q1 Correct Answer:

> “hasNext() only checks if the next element exists.
> It does NOT move the pointer.”

## ✔ Q2 Correct Answer:

> “next() moves the cursor to the next element first, then returns that element.”

# ⭐ Super Simple Memory Trick

### 🟡 hasNext() = **LOOK only**

(no movement)

### 🟢 next() = **WALK and PICK**

(move + return element)

# ⭐ Clear Comparison Table

| Method        | Moves Cursor? | Returns Element? | Description              |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| **hasNext()** | ❌ No          | ❌ No             | Only checks availability |
| **next()**    | ✔ Yes         | ✔ Yes            | Moves forward & returns  |

---

# ⭐ Visualization Example

Initial:

```
^ A B C
```

Call hasNext():

```
^ A B C     (no movement)
```

Call next():

```
A ^ B C     (cursor moved; A returned)
```

Call next():

```
A B ^ C     (cursor moved; B returned)
```
