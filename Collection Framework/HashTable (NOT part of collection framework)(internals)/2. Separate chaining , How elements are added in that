Great question, Onkar! 🔥
You want to understand **exactly how elements are added in Separate Chaining** when a collision happens – whether the new node goes **before** or **after** the old node.

Let me explain this **clearly, correctly, simply** 👇

---

# ⭐ WHAT IS SEPARATE CHAINING?

When two keys go to the **same bucket index**, HashMap stores them in a:

✔ **Linked List** (Java 7)
✔ **Linked List → Red-Black Tree** (Java 8+)

Inside the **same bucket**.

---

# ⭐ IMPORTANT: **Order of insertion matters**

### ✔ NEW node is added **at the beginning** of the linked list

(not at the end)

This is how Java’s HashMap actually works internally.

---

# ⭐ EXAMPLE (Your Example)

Let’s say:

1. `"Onkar"` → bucket index 5
2. `"Akash"` → bucket index 5 (collision)

### Bucket 5 BEFORE collision:

```
[ Onkar ]
```

### After inserting Akash (collision)

Java adds **new node at the head**:

Bucket 5 becomes:

```
[ Akash ] → [ Onkar ]
```

✔ **New element always becomes head**
✔ Old elements get pushed forward
✔ This makes insertion faster (O(1))

---

# ⭐ WHY NEW ELEMENT COMES FIRST?

Because:

* Adding at the **beginning** of a linked list is O(1)
* Adding at the **end** requires traversal (O(n))
* HashMap wants FAST insertion → **so it inserts at HEAD**

This is the Java internal implementation.

---

# ⭐ SUMMARY (VERY IMPORTANT)

If `"Onkar"` and `"Akash"` have same hash bucket:

### HashMap stores:

```
Akash → Onkar
```

NOT:

```
Onkar → Akash
```

So for your sentence:

> “akash -> onkar or vice versa?”

Correct answer:

### ✔ Always **Akash → Onkar**

(because Akash is inserted **later**)

---

# ⭐ FULL PICTURE

Bucket 5:

```
HEAD
 ↓
[ Akash ] -> [ Onkar ] -> null
```

If you insert one more:

3. `"Vikas"` → same bucket

New chain becomes:

```
[ Vikas ] -> [ Akash ] -> [ Onkar ]
```

---

# ⭐ INTERVIEW ANSWER (Perfect Line)

> “HashMap uses separate chaining for collisions.
> When a new entry goes to a bucket which already has nodes,
> the new node is inserted at the head of the linked list inside that bucket.”

If you want, next I can explain:

✔ When linked list becomes a Red-Black Tree
✔ How equals() is used to detect duplicate keys
✔ How rehashing works (resize process)

Just say **“go ahead”**!
