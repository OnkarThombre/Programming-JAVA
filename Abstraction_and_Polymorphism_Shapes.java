//Explanation
Exactly üëç you‚Äôve got the right intuition. Let me explain clearly why you declared `calArea()` as **abstract in the `Shape` class**.

---

### üîπ 1. The role of `Shape` (Abstract Class)

* `Shape` represents a **general concept** of a shape.
* Every shape (rectangle, square, circle, triangle, etc.) has an **area**, but **the formula is different** for each.

So you can‚Äôt define a single fixed formula in `Shape`.
Instead, you declare an **abstract method**:

```java
abstract double calArea();
```

This means:

* "Every subclass must provide its own implementation of `calArea()`."

---

### üîπ 2. Why Abstract?

If you didn‚Äôt make it abstract, then:

* Either `Shape` would need to provide some *dummy/default* implementation (which doesn‚Äôt make sense for area).
* Or subclasses wouldn‚Äôt be forced to implement it, which breaks the OOP design.

By making it abstract ‚Üí the compiler **forces all child classes** (`Rectangle`, `Square`, `Circle`) to override and provide their own logic.

---

### üîπ 3. Benefit in Your Code

Now, in your `main()` method, you can write:

```java
Shape s1 = new Rectangle(10 , 20);
Shape s2 = new Square(10);
Shape s3 = new Circle(2);

System.out.println("Rectangle : " + s1.displayArea());
System.out.println("Square : " + s2.displayArea());
System.out.println("Circle : " + s3.displayArea());
```

Here:

* You are using **polymorphism** ‚Üí the same method `calArea()` is called, but the actual implementation depends on whether the object is a `Rectangle`, `Square`, or `Circle`.
* You didn‚Äôt need to write `s1.calArea()`, `s2.calArea()`, etc. separately. The abstract method + polymorphism handled it for you.

---

### ‚úÖ In Simple Words

* **Abstract method** in `Shape` = a **promise** that "every shape must know how to calculate its area."
* Each subclass (Rectangle, Square, Circle) provides its **own formula**.
* `Shape` can now work as a **common reference type**, letting you treat all shapes in a unified way.

---

üëâ That‚Äôs why you made `calArea()` abstract in `Shape` ‚Üí to **enforce** that all shapes must define their own way of calculating area while still being able to treat them as a general `Shape`.

---

Do you want me to also make a **real-world analogy** (like ‚Äúabstract class = contract, subclasses = workers fulfilling contract‚Äù) so you can remember this easily in interviews?
