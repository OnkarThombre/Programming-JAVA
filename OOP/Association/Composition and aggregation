Excellent 👏 — that’s a **classic real-world example** to understand association types.

Let’s analyze it carefully 👇

---

## 🚗 Example: **Car has an Engine**

### 🔹 Relationship Type: **Composition (Tight Coupling)**

### 🧩 Reason:

* A **Car** **owns** its **Engine**.
* The **Engine** is created **as part of** the Car.
* If the **Car** is destroyed, the **Engine** (inside it) is also gone.
* The **Engine** doesn’t make sense without the **Car** (in this context — it’s not shared between cars).

---

### ✅ Example Code:

```java
class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine is starting...");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine; // Composition

    public Car() {
        engine = new Engine(); // Car creates and owns the Engine
    }

    void startCar() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is running...");
    }
}

public class CompositionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.startCar();
    }
}
```

### 💬 Explanation:

* `Car` is the **dependent** class (depends on `Engine` to run).
* `Engine` is the **dependency** (used by `Car`).
* Lifecycle is **dependent** — when the `Car` is destroyed, its `Engine` object is destroyed too.

### ⚙️ Note:

If we slightly change the scenario, it can become **Aggregation** instead 👇

---

## 🪢 Example: **Car and Shared Engine (Aggregation)**

Imagine a garage testing multiple cars using the same engine (for testing purpose).
Now the **Engine** exists **independently** of any single Car.

### ✅ Example Code:

```java
class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine is starting...");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine; // Aggregation

    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine; // Car is using an existing Engine
    }

    void startCar() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is running...");
    }
}

public class AggregationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Engine testEngine = new Engine(); // created independently
        Car car1 = new Car(testEngine);
        Car car2 = new Car(testEngine);

        car1.startCar();
        car2.startCar();
    }
}
```

### 💬 Explanation:

* Here, `Engine` exists **independently** of `Car`.
* Multiple cars can **share** the same engine → **Loose coupling (Aggregation)**.
* If `Car` is destroyed, the `Engine` still exists.

### 🔍 Summary Table:

| Example                                   | Type            | Relationship   | Lifecycle                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| `Car` → `Engine` (normal real-world case) | **Composition** | Strong “has-a” | Engine dies with Car       |
| `Car` → `Engine` (shared test engine)     | **Aggregation** | Weak “has-a”   | Engine lives independently |

---

So in short 👇

> 🚗 **Car–Engine** = **Composition** (in real-world or typical design)
> 🧰 But if Engine is shared or reused, it becomes **Aggregation**

Would you like me to show both these cases as a simple UML diagram (with black and white diamonds)? It makes the concept super clear visually.
